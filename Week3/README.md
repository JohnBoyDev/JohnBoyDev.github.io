# README: Changes Between PDF/Original and Web Version

This file explains the significant differences between the original PDF version ("What is Markdown?") and the web version.

## Structure and Layout

**PDF/Original Version:**
- The layout is dense and designed for print or static viewing.
- All content is presented in continuous text, using basic formatting (bold, italics, underlined links).
- The code block appears as plain text with a light background.
- There is a singular image without a caption in the article in Markdown.

**Web Version:**
- The layout uses more whitespace, which makes scanning and reading on a screen easier.
- Headings (like the title and author) are larger and bolder for quick identification.
- Hyperlinks are colored and stand out more.
- The code block is in a dark, visually distinct box that highlights the syntax, improving readability for programmers.
- I have added an image showing a screenshot of a code editor with Markdown, which visually demonstrates the topic.

## Content

- The actual text in both versions is the same. I did not add, remove, or rewrite any paragraphs.
- The main visual change is the addition of an editor screenshot near the top of the web version.
- The code example displays the duplicate content, but the web version uses improved formatting for clarity.

## User Experience

**PDF/Original:**
- Best suited for printing or offline reading.
- No interactive or visual elements beyond basic text formatting.

**Web Version:**
- Optimized for online reading: more visual hierarchy, enhanced code display, and an illustrative image.
- Easier to navigate and understand at a glance, especially for those new to Markdown.

## Summary Table

| Aspect            | PDF/Original            | Web Version                        |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Layout            | Dense, print-oriented  | Spaced out, screen-friendly         |
| Headings          | Plain                  | Large, bold, easy to find           |
| Links             | Basic underline/color  | More visually prominent             |
| Code Block        | Light, plain text      | Dark, highlighted, easy to read     |
| Images            | None                   | Editor screenshot added             |
| Content Changes   | None                   | None (text is the same)             |

## Conclusion

To sum up, the web version is restructured for better on-screen readability. I added a screenshot to help readers visualize the Markdown center of the webpage, and improved how code and headings are displayed. However, the core content remains unchanged from the original PDF. The changes are all about making the page easier to read and more useful for web users.
