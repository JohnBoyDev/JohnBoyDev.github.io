            <h2>HTML Activity: Crap Principles</h2>
            <h4>John Channell</h4>
            <p>The website we will be analyzing is <a href="https://turo.com/us/en/car-rental/united-states/fort-worth-tx" target="_blank">Turo Rental Cars</a>. This website has many different vehicles for rent available on the home page. This page is specifically for Fort Worth, Texas.</p>
            <p>Built with help from the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 5</a> styling package.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="m-5 px-2">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col py-3">
                <h4 class="text-center">Contrast</h4>
                <p>The first look into contrast puts an emphasis on the featured vehicles available for rent in Fort Worth. By putting them front and center on the website there is a distinct interest given towards these vehicles.</p>
                <span class="mx-auto d-block">
                    <img src="img/C-1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                </span>
                <p>Directly below that is a visual break showcasing a vehicle in Fort Worth. Giving a synopsis of why renting a vehicle for Fort Worth would be a great idea.</p>
                <span class="mx-auto d-block">
                    <img src="img/C-2.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="col py-3">
                <h4 class="text-center">Repetition</h4>
                <p>The next princple is repetition. Giving the reader something to follow when enjoying a web-page. Let's look at the repetition provided by seeing the different cars that show up through the page. Let's take a look at the first image again:</p>
                <span class="mx-auto d-block">
                    <img src="img/C-1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                </span>
                <p>Then when you scroll further to find more information, there is a repeated emphasis on the different vehicles available for rent through Turo. This gives the reader a higher rate of engagement.</p>
                <span class="mx-auto d-block">
                    <img src="img/R-2.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="col py-3">
                <h4 class="text-center">Alignment</h4>
                <p>This website is interesting because of how everything is center aligned. The containers, at least. The text looks to be left-aligned, but it is important to note that there is an emphasis of the reader staying in the middle of the screen.</p>
                <span class="mx-auto d-block">
                    <img src="img/A-1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                </span>
                <p>When viewing the next section, it again keeps everything centerted. Moving the text for the comparison to the center keeps the reader's visual engagement. Then there is contrast thrown in when you're viewing both comparisons and contrasts.</p>
                <span class="mx-auto d-block">
                    <img src="img/A-2.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="col py-3">
                <h4 class="text-center">Proximity</h4>
                <p>I will keep this section more brief than previous ones.</p>
                <p>Everything is once again closely related to each other. The lists, the images, the reasons for why you should rent. Take any image from the previous principles and it becomes obvious how close proximity is thought of with this website.</p>
                <p>By focusing on the other sections as a whole, we can infer a lot of how they are closely related to each other. Meaning that proximity is one of the more important focuses on this website. Everything is grouped together to encourage a potential client that there are many reasons to rent a car from their service.</p>
