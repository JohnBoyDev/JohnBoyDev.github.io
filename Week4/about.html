        <h2>My Experience in Web Design and Writing</h2>
        <p>Throughout my academic journey and professional projects, I have consistently prioritized the integration of effective writing and thoughtful web design. My involvement in the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Professional Writing program allowed me to hone my skills in crafting clear, engaging content tailored to diverse audiences. I actively participated in designing and publishing digital publications, such as the transition of MEMORANDUM from print to WordPress-based online formats, showcasing my ability to adapt content for modern platforms while maintaining a compelling voice.</p>
        <p>My technical proficiency extends into web development and programming, evident through projects like developing a PHP User Framework focused on secure authentication and best coding practices. This hands-on experience with PHP, MariaDB, and server-side scripting has deepened my understanding of creating functional, user-centric websites. Additionally, my familiarity with tools such as WordPress, Adobe Creative Suite, and Visual Studio Code enables me to design visually appealing and user-friendly websites.</p>
        <p>Whether working on large-scale projects or small creative endeavors, I believe that effective communication—both in text and digital presentation—is fundamental to engaging audiences and achieving goals. My background in writing, combined with my technical skills and ongoing projects, fosters a holistic approach to web design and content creation that values clarity, accessibility, and innovation.</p>
